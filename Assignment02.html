This my previous index for Assignment 2. Since there is a lack of content to put in, I've decided
to write down the thought process behind it and format that instead.

        <p id='Assn2-p01'>This assignment was a relatively simple one, just create a web page. The hard part was deciding how I wanted it to look.
           My lack of experience with CSS and how much I could do was a problem. Below is my previous index, very simple design. In the end I 
           couldn't decide because there was so much to learn about.

                 because of formatting reasons. It should be noted that clicking Assignment02 redirects back 
                 to this page which is redundant I admit-->
