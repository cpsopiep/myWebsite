Fixed most of the problems, such as Document.write() overwriting page
Used the lazy but easy way of updating the page in one go with innerHTML

Still need to look into finding a way to detect letters between integers like "8a8"
Also need to deal with float numbers like 1.342423
Since 1.432234 * 2.342332 = 2
