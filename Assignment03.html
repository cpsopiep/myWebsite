    <p id="Assn3-p01">Below is my current home page. I basically took my original home page
     and split it up in order to make it look nicer.</p>
    
    <!-- Fairly simple design which turned out difficult to execute
         Need to do some organizing perhaps to get the function I want,
         code is a mess -->
    <img src="Intro.png" alt= " Alternate Index ">
        
    <p id="Assn3-p02">However I intended for the top half to be some sort of navigation bar
     while the bottom half outputs the page contents so the user doesn't have to click so much.</p>
    
    <!-- I don't intend for the resolution to be that small but I didn't want to
         flood the screen to make my point.-->
    <img src="Intention.png" alt="What Should Have Been">
        
    <p id='Assn3-p03'>Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to go about doing this so
    I left it like that. Might look into using JSFiddle to rectify that problem. Links still work
    but you need to click more to navigate my site.</p>
