This is my redone index for Assignment 3, the idea is creating a navigation bar with 2 headers at the top.
The user clicks on the link which displays its content at the bottom while the header and navigation bar
stays at the top. Unfortunately I haven't fully grasped the concept of articles and sections yet.
Might have to resort to JSFiddle or bootstrap.

                rmargin removes the margins while formatting the links
                Home may seem redundant but once I implement the navigation bar
                it should be useful when navigating through the site
