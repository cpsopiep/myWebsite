        <p id='Assn4-p01'>This was a simple assignment, I followed the directions given in
         the instructional video by Curran Kelleher.
         The video itself was very informative, one complaint is that annoying right ear noise.</p>
        
        <!-- Wasn't sure about resolution but at least the video works
             Hope its not removed if you are reading this-->

        <p id='Assn4-p02'>Didn't run into problems setting up my website on GitHub.
             Below is said website. Note that it may redirect to an outdated page.</p>
        
        <!-- I know you can make it so that you can auto update your repository
             but I'm not sure if we will be using the Git Hub website again, 
             doesn't hurt to update it though-->
